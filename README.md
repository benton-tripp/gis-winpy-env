# GIS Python Virtual Environment Setup for Windows PCs
I have run into some troubles using `pip install` for some of the more common GIS Python libraries. I wrote this `bash` script to help easily create a Python virtual environment, with some of the essential GIS libraries (e.g., `geopandas`). <br>
## Instructions
*Note: I use Git Bash to execute my shell script* <br>
1) Open `gen_env.sh` and ensure there aren't any additional libraries that you would like to include. <br>
2) Make executable using `chmod +x gen_env.sh` <br>
3) Execute using `. gen_env.sh <venv_name>` <br>
<br>
And that's it!
